## What is Markdown?

So the Markdown is a language to simplify your way to write your notes, Documents, your Readme file ... 

instead of using the fu\*\*ing boring Microsoft Word or the html wasting time opening and closing brackets! you can easily write the same thing just using some extensions that saves you a lot of time. 

## What's on this article ?

Am **HERE** to give you all the shortcuts that you gonna need, not **wasting** your time about how the Markdown work !

Check the [official website](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) so that you can get information about Markdown and how it works and some stuff like that. 


# <u>Let's start !</u>
## 1 - Simple paragraph 

Add nothing to your text just start writing, but for the **new line** you need to create a space between the first paragraph and the second.


![fv](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/c22684f57050229153ce197b6cf31b03c3122f3aa6a67fb6fd43b471a34ff267/68747470733a2f2f692e6962622e636f2f6b6d5846775a362f696d6167652e706e67)

Also there is another way by adding two spaces after the first paragraph.

<br>

## 2 - Headings

Using the ' # ' character, and whenever you use less hashtags the header gonna be bigger.
The max of the header size is like the html header, if you pass over six hashtags the Markdown read it as a normal text.

<br>

## 3- **Bold**, *Italic* and ~~Strikethrough~~ Effect


>Note that on this part you can replace the \* Character with the  \_  character and everything work fine.

 1. ***Italic*** :
To make your part of text Italic you just need to put it between one asterisk character `*YOUR TEXT*` ---> *YOUR TEXT*

 2. **Bold** :
  And for the **Bold** effect just write it between two asterisk character `**YOUR TEXT**`  ---> **YOUR TEXT**

>Tip : Before you continue reading the next paragraph you now that 1 + 2 = 3 do you hh??

So what if i wanna use a text ***Bold & Italic*** at the same time ?
That's easy my friend! use that brain and find the solution by yourself am believing in you . 

3. **Strikethrough** :
For the Strickthrough effect just use two `~` character : `~~Jesse~~` ---> ~~Jesse~~

## 4 - Code blocks 

For implementing a code area to your notes and you have just one line, word or even character, you just need to put it inside one ``` ` ``` Character, so that ``` `Walter` ``` --->
`Walter`

If you have a long code, use three ` ``` ` characters, so that for example :

- instead of writing the boring way :  

\#include<unistd.h>
int main()
{
	write (1, "42", 2);
}  

- you can just use the Markdown code block:   
```c
#include <unistd.h>
int main()
{
	write(1, "42", 2);
}
```  

And a beautiful thing that you can have some decoration of the exact language you use.  
You just need to add the language  name beside the three ``` ` ``` :  
```
	```html
		<a href = "https://github.com/Zanana-med/">Welcome to my github</a>
	```
```  

the result Text gonna be :
```html
<a href = "https://github.com/Zanana-med/">Welcome to my github</a>
```

<br>

## 5 - Links / Images :

To use a clickable link or to display an image on your notes shared the same syntax, for the image you gonna need to add  `!` at the beginning of the syntax.  

- **Links :**
The syntax is : `[]()` So inside the square brackets you put the message that gonna display to you, and inside the parentheses you write the `url` of the link you want to use .  
For example : `[Check my Profile](https://github.com/Zanana-med)`  
gonna used as  : [Check my Profile](https://github.com/Zanana-med)    

- **Images** :
The same thing as Links you just add a `!` on the beginning of the syntax.  
`![The message displayed when the picture failed loading](The link of the picture you wanna use)`  
For example :   
```
![Linux King](https://i.ibb.co/By5n51K/image.png)
```

The result is what you see here :

</p>

<br>

## 6 - Blockquotes

I think you notice some paragraphs on this article having some special color and background, like this message :  
>Note That ...

So to use like this style you need just to start your paragraph with a ` > `

 Like that : ` >Note That ...`   
 So the result is the message :  
 >Note That ...  

<br>

## 7 - Horizontal line

Am also sure that on the example of the simple paragraph (the first image), you notice that i separate the paragraphs using an horizontal link and you ask yourself how this man did it.  
Also am sure that you can notice that the line was created using the three `-`   

Perfect!   
Am gonna just add to your knowledge that you can use the same think with the three `*` or three `_` also.  

So :

## 8 - Lists 

1. **Ordered List**   

The important is just the number followed by a dot and a space, its not matter that you number the list by the order 1, 2, 3...  

![Ordered List](https://i.ibb.co/235PhST/image.png)


2. **Unordered List**   
You gonna replace the numbers with one of those  characters (They do the same thing !)
`*`, `-` or `+`   

![Unordered List](https://i.ibb.co/yYB7D6d/image.png)


3. **Nested List**  
Use a `Tab` key or four `Spaces` to make a nested list

<br>

## 9 - Tables

Yes DO YOU BELIEVE IT !   
With just three characters you can make a table.  
Just using those three magical characters  `|` , `-`  and `:` you can create a table, and this picture explain to you exactly how you can do it !    

Just separate the title from the content by three `-` at least    

![Structured Table](https://i.ibb.co/YZtdt5n/image.png)


Never mind i got you! Not everytime the content gonna be structured and little like the example above!    
Markdown automatically  gonna fix the issue   

![unstructured table](https://i.ibb.co/71GWp8g/image.png)


And also you don't wanna the text to be on the left ?  
We got you !   
It is the time for our third magical character now  `:`  

place the `:` where do you want the content to be. And yes you find the solution now   

![Right, Center and Left the content of the table](https://i.ibb.co/bg4MDqR/image.png) 

<br>

## 10 - CheckLists 

We all know how to create a list, to make a Checklist now we just add the square brackets `[]`   


+ [ ] For the empty case just make one `space` inside the square brackets ` + [ ] UnChecked`

+ [x] For the checked case fill it with a `x` or `X`, they do the same thing 
`+ [X] Checked case`

![Checklist](https://i.ibb.co/XsKmqwb/image.png)

## 11 - Table of content

The table of contents is when at the top of the file you click at a link and goes to the section on the file wherever it is.  

There is some rules to follow to avoid any conflicts, here is step by step to create a table of content on markdown language :  

+ **1 - Convert to Lowercase :** All letters become lowercase, so `My Header` became `my header`;  
+ **2 - Replace punctuation :** Any special character is stripped. So for example `What's % & ' ( ) * + New?` -> `whats new`;  
+ **3 - Replace spaces with hyphens `-` :** All spaces become `-` so `my header title` become `my-header-title`;  
+ **4 - Keep hyphens and underscores :** `My-Title_2025` -> `my-title_2025`;  
+ **5 - Inline HTML is ignored :** The tags ate pare of the anchor, `<u>Start Here!</u>` -> `start-here`
+ **6 - Duplicate header :** If there is more than one header with the same context Github appends `-1`, `-2`, etc. `#my-header`, `#my-header-1`, `#my-header-2`, etc.
